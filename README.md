kabu
====
Kabu is a system for automatically guiding programmers to likely metamoprhic properties, developed by the [Programming Systems Lab](http://psl.cs.columbia.edu). at Columbia University. Kabu uses an approach similar to [Daikon](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/), in that it observes program executions to identify properties that hold.

Kabu is under very active development, and is not yet complete, but is known to work on small applications. If you have comments or feedback, please directly contact [Mike Su](mailto:mikefhsu@cs.columbia.edu).
